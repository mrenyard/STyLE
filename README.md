# STyLE - The Semantically Themed & Layered Elemental based CSS Framework.

Inspired by RAMP's semantic HTML Template patterns as its base, STyLE works from the premise that semantic web documents and application have all the necessary elements (hooks) for a fully fledged CSS framework. That any content or data structure created with a certain set of principles and conventions can be visually displayed and manipulated with CSS to produce a variety of visually pleasing, user friendly, user centric designs.

AIs response to the term 'Semantically Themed & Layered Elemental'...

"Semantically themed & Layered elemental" describes a design approach that combines the meaningful organisation of content with a visually and structurally rich composition.
## Semantically Themed
This concept focuses on the meaning and context of elements within a system, ensuring they relate in a logical and consistent way.
 - **Meaningful Organisation:** Elements are grouped and related based on their inherent meaning or function, rather than just aesthetics or technical structure. For example, in an artistic context, all items related to a "forest" theme (trees, animals, specific colours) would be conceptually linked.
 - **Contextual Relevance:** The design ensures that context is maintained, allowing users or systems to understand the relationships between different parts.
    Single Source of Truth: By establishing a consistent logic and shared terminology, it creates a unified view that prevents inconsistencies.

## Layered Elemental
This aspect refers to the composition using distinct, fundamental components arranged in a hierarchical or multi-level structure.
 - **Elemental Forms:** The design is built from basic, fundamental components or "elements" (e.g., in art: colours, shapes, textures; in data: core data points or metrics).
 - **Hierarchical Layers:** These elements are organised into different tiers or layers, where higher layers build upon and interact with lower layers.
 - **Interoperability and Complexity:** The layering allows for the creation of complex interactions and systems from simpler parts, while maintaining the ability to understand information at lower levels. For instance, a complex painting might reveal a "simple play of layered elemental forms" upon closer inspection.

## In Summary
When combined, the phrase suggests a design that is both deeply meaningful and logically structured ("semantically themed") and built up from basic components arranged in an organised hierarchy ("layered elemental"). This approach likely aims for a result that is intuitive to understand, visually rich, and structurally sound."
